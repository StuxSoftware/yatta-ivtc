// problems
// how to signal changes to a gui: the controller part has to know which
// operations trigger an update, the core will never have implicit ones
// for dynamic events such as dmetrics becoming available as a

// have them take a pointer to the parent, decide which objects will always
// exist

TYattaProject class
    // video source abstraction class
    // the abstraction class itself will handle cutting and posssibly caching
    // there will be several providers behind the abstraction
    // ffms2 and avisynth_c backed video will be required at first
    // needs to have seamless cloning so metrics collection,
    // gui needs and such don't interfere with each other
    //
    // a separate class will wrap avisynth preview
    // idea: make the avisynth_c source also work when
    // is is fed a script, so the code can be shared between them

    // field matching metric containers
    // one for telecide metric
    // one for tfm metrics

    // field matching handler
    // responsible for storing the matches
    // it will also maintain a separate freezeframe list which it uses as
    // on overlay to the matches, this is partly for user convenience and
    // partly to not show "weird" matches instead of pointing out the real
    // intent, to copy a frame
    // it will also expose a property to tell if the current frame is
    // affected by a freezeframe

    // decimation metrics collector
    // blindly collects metrics every time a match is changed
    // possibly multithreaded so one thread can wait
    // to fix up user input while the others look ahead in the file
    // without a loaded video file this will just act like
    // a dmetric container
    // the actual metric calculationimplementation will most likely be borrowed
    // straight from tdecimate
    // needs access to the current matches to work properly

    // decimation handler
    // examines the decimation metrics and matches together to produce a
    // decision, will invoke the metrics collector when the necessary
    // dmetrics are unavailable to produce a decision
    // it will also be aware of common matching patterns such as ccnnc and
    // the proper frame to remove during 1 in 5 decimation
    // markers will set the start of every decimation region in the same
    // style as section markers do
    // m in n decimation will then be set for every region, with freedecimate-
    // like behavior being producable by allowing both m and n to be very
    // large numbers
    // there shall be a way for a user to implement the decimation script for
    // a section, much like a decimation preset, to implement increases or
    // complicated reductions in framerate beyond normal decimation
    // behavior in the "gaps" before a new decimation marker where there isn't
    // enough room to handle a full cycle poses a problem, the easiest way is
    // most likely to leave all the frames in such a gap, and to avoid these
    // cases as much as possible clearly hint the user on where the cycle
    // borders are
    // will handle a list of decimation presets as well

    // layer container
    // has a preset handling class as well, the preset class will always
    // provide the "null" default preset and it should be unchangable, also
    // a preset should not be deletable if it's in use
    // handles section and custom list style layers
    // stores ordering of the layers, including a special marker for
    // matching placement
