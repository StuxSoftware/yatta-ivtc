<h1>SCXvid 1.0</h1>
<p>SCXvid produces first pass xvid logs from avisynth at the equuivalent of the default vfw preset. These logs are primaliy intended to get scenechange information from but could probably be used in some kind of twisted encoding setup too with lossless encoding of the output.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Mpeg2source("some_progressive.d2v")<br/>
SCXvid("C:\xvid_first_pass.log")<br/>
</p>

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>SCXvid(clip, string log)<br />
All arguments are required<br />
The clip can be in any colorspace and will be converted internally to yv12 with xvid's routines<br />
Log is the output filename
</p>

<h2>The Rest</h2>
<p>SCXvid was created by Fredrik Mellbin. You can find my avisynth related things at <a href="http://ivtc.org/">ivtc.org</a> and if you want to contact me I can be found in the doom9 forums and in #darkhold on irc.deltaanime.net.
